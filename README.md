# Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (by James D. McCaffrey)

A simple implementation of particle swarm optimization algorithm by James D. McCaffrey. In PSO, you have a set of “particles”. Each particle represents a possible solution. Particles move towards a new location/solution based on 1.) their current direction, 2.) the best location/solution they’ve encountered so far, and 3.) the best location/solution that’s been found by any of the particles in the swarm.
